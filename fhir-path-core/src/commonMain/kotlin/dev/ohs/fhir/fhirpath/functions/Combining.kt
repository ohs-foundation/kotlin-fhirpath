 *
 * TODO: Correct URL once https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-52050 is addressed.
 *
 * Duplicates are detected on the converted FHIRPath values, but the original items are kept and the
 * first occurrence of each value wins. The surviving representation therefore depends on operand
 * order: if `a` holds a FHIR string and `b` a FHIRPath string of the same value, `a.union(b)` keeps
 * the FHIR string and `b.union(a)` keeps the FHIRPath string. Both results are equal per the `=`
 * operator, and the specification does not prescribe which duplicate to keep.
